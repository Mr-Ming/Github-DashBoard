# Github Dash Board
The dashboard provide the following summarizations:

Most popular repositories by:
1. Stars
2. Forks
3. Contributors
4. Top internal contributors: these should be the users who are public members of the organization ranked by their contributions to repositories belonging to the organization.
5. Top external contributions: same as internal contributors, except for users who are not public members of the organization.

* One important note: If you use a username instead of an organization name then the contributors will show up as external contributors

## To Run The Program
1. Clone this branch
2. CD into its directory
3. `Run npm install && npm start`

## Future Work
1. Need to add notification (if someone uses a username instead of an organization name)
2. Need to add unit test and integration test
3. Need to improve UI
